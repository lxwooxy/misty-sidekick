# Contributing to Misty-Python-SDK 🤖💻

Hey there! Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Misty Python SDK. This project is still in BETA, and any help—big or small—is super appreciated.

This SDK is built to make it easier to talk to your Misty II robot in Python. It mirrors Misty's API structure, with some Pythonic flair.

---

## 🛠 What You Can Work On

Here are a few ways you can help:

- 🧪 **Bug Fixes**: If something’s broken, help squash that bug!
- 🔧 **Improvements**: Know a neater way to handle something? Send it in.
- 📚 **Docs**: Even fixing typos or adding examples is helpful.
- ⚡ **New Features**: Got an idea for a new method or tool? Let’s hear it.

---

## 🧾 Before You Start

1. **Check Python Version**  
   This project uses `python >= 3.8`.

2. **Install Dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt

yaml
Copy
Edit

3. **Set up your Misty IP**
- Create a `.env` file in the root.
- Add: `MISTY_IP=XXX.XX.XX.X`  
(Replace with your robot's IP address.)

---

## 💡 Style Notes

- We use [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf) for formatting.  
Run `yapf -i your_file.py` before opening a PR.
- Try to keep method names aligned with Misty’s API Explorer format.
- Keep things readable—comments and docstrings help a ton!

---

## 🚀 Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repo and create your branch:
git checkout -b feature/your-thing

yaml
Copy
Edit
2. Make your changes and test them.
3. Run `yapf` to format your code.
4. Open a Pull Request and describe what you did.
5. That’s it! I’ll take a look and we can go from there.

---

## 🧪 Testing

There’s no full test suite yet (it's coming), but if you add examples or test code, drop them into `demo.py` or create a new `examples/` file.

---

## ✨ A Final Note

This started as a personal SDK for playing with Misty, so some parts might feel rough around the edges. Your contributions can help polish it up for everyone!

Thanks again & happy hacking with Misty! 🤖💙

You said:
keep in mind this is my own clone of the original misty sdk, and I didn't create the python functions – it's all just my work based on the packages provided, so I'm writing code to make misty do stuff

Got it! Since this is your personal clone of the Misty SDK and you’re writing Python code on top of what Misty provides (rather than building the SDK from scratch), here’s a more accurate and casual CONTRIBUTING.md that reflects that context:

# Contributing to Misty-Python-SDK 🤖🐍

Hey there! This is a **personal working repo** for messing around with Misty II using Python. The SDK methods themselves are based on Misty’s official API and naming conventions—I didn’t build those from scratch. Instead, this repo focuses on writing Python code to control Misty and make her do cool stuff. 🚀

That said, feel free to contribute if you’re also playing with Misty and want to improve things, share examples, or help clean things up!

---

## 🙌 What You Can Help With

- ✨ **New Examples**: Write scripts that use Misty’s functions in fun or useful ways.
- 🧽 **Code Cleanup**: Help refactor or improve readability (especially if you see some spaghetti code).
- 🐞 **Fix Mistakes**: Typo in an endpoint? Parameter order wrong? Spot it, fix it!
- 📓 **Documentation**: Add better usage notes, especially for things Misty’s official docs don’t explain well.

---

## 🛠 Setup

1. **Python version:** `>= 3.8`
2. **Install dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt

yaml
Copy
Edit
3. **Set up your Misty IP:**
- Make a `.env` file in the root directory.
- Add this line:
  ```
  MISTY_IP=XXX.XX.XX.X
  ```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Style Guide

- Use [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf) to format code:
yapf -i your_file.py

yaml
Copy
Edit
- Stick to the Misty API Explorer's naming where it makes sense.
- Keep things Pythonic, readable, and easy to test.

---

## 📦 Structure

This repo is still in flux. Most of it is:
- Python method wrappers for Misty’s commands
- Notes from Misty documentation + trial & error
- Demo scripts and test snippets (like `demo.py`)
- A method generator that helps keep things up to date

---

## 🚀 Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repo, make a branch:
git checkout -b your-feature-name

kotlin
Copy
Edit
2. Make your changes + test them.
3. Format with `yapf`.
4. Open a PR with a short description.

No pressure to be perfect—this repo is for experimenting!

## 🙌 Credit & Attribution

The scripts and code in this repository are part of an independent research project using Misty II. While the SDK itself is from Misty Robotics, this repo includes original work to make it easier to control and experiment with Misty using Python.

If you build on these tools, a shoutout or link back is appreciated!
